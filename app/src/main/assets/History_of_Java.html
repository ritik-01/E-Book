<p><strong>The history of Java</strong>&nbsp;is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of java starts with Green Team. Java team members (also known as&nbsp;<strong>Green Team</strong>), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.</p>
<p>The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted and Dynamic".</p>

<p>Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. There are given the significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/james-gosling-father-of-java">James Gosling</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Mike Sheridan</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Patrick Naughton</strong>&nbsp;initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called&nbsp;<strong>Green Team</strong>.</p>
<p>2) Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.</p>
<p>3) Firstly, it was called&nbsp;<strong>"Greentalk"</strong>&nbsp;by James Gosling, and file extension was .gt.</p>
<p>4) After that, it was called&nbsp;<strong>Oak</strong>&nbsp;and was developed as a part of the Green project.</p>
<h2 class="h3">Why Java named "Oak"?</h2>
<p>5)&nbsp;<strong>Why Oak?</strong>&nbsp;Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.</p>
<p>6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as&nbsp;<strong>"Java"</strong>&nbsp;because it was already a trademark by Oak Technology</p>
<h2 class="h3">Why Java Programming named "Java"?</h2>
<p>7)&nbsp;<strong>Why had they chosen java name for java language?</strong>&nbsp;The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.</p>
<p>According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with&nbsp;<strong>Silk</strong>". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.</p>
<p>8) Java is an island of Indonesia where first coffee was produced (called java coffee).</p>
<p>9) Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.</p>
<p>10) Initially developed by James Gosling at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/sun-microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>&nbsp;(which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.</p>
<p>11) In 1995, Time magazine called&nbsp;<strong>Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995</strong>.</p>
<p>12) JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996).</p>
