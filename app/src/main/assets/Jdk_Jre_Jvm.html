<p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>JRE</strong>&nbsp;stands for&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Java Runtime Environment&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;and may also be written as&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Java RTE.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the&nbsp;<em>Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes</em>, and&nbsp;<em>supporting files</em>.</p>

<p>It is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp;<strong>specification</strong>&nbsp;where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by Sun and other companies.</li>
<li>An&nbsp;<strong>implementation</strong>&nbsp;is a computer program that meets the requirements of the JVM specification</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Instance</strong>&nbsp;Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the java class, an instance of JVM is created.</li>
</ul>
