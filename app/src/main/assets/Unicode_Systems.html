<h1 class="h1">Unicode System</h1>
<p>Unicode is a universal international standard character encoding that is capable of representing most of the world's written languages.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Why java uses Unicode System?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ASCII</strong>&nbsp;(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) for the United States.</li>
<li><strong>ISO 8859-1</strong>&nbsp;for Western European Language.</li>
<li><strong>KOI-8</strong>&nbsp;for Russian.</li>
<li><strong>GB18030 and BIG-5</strong>&nbsp;for chinese, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h2">Problem</h2>
<p>?<strong>This caused two problems:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A particular code value corresponds to different letters in the various language standards.</li>
<li>The encodings for languages with large character sets have variable length.Some common characters are encoded as single bytes, other require two or more byte.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="h2">Solution</h2>
<p>To solve these problems, a new language standard was developed i.e. Unicode System. In unicode, character holds 2 byte, so java also uses 2 byte for characters.<br /> <strong>lowest value:</strong>\u0000 <br /> <strong>highest value:</strong>\uFFF</p>
